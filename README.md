## EMC Annotate

The aim of this repository is to automatically identify features in the spectrum

Deliverable 1: Automate the pattern finding for power supplies, HDMI and displayport.  Alex has been able to visually see patterns that define these.  So using an appropriate pattern finding model be able to take in a new input spectrum and detect whether it has the pattern for power supply, HDMI or displayport with a strength score.

Deliverable 2: Display the score/flags visually on the viewer so a new file can be viewed with a score or a suggestion associated with them

Deliverable 3: Allow the viewer and associated pattern model to be updated to take in more patterns by Kenlock and provide documentation on the requirements for the file inputs etc.
